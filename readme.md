# Project TIKEBook

## What is TIKE?
The Timeseries Integrated Knowledge Engine, or [TIKE](https://timeseries.science.stsci.edu) is a free, cloud-based compute environment provided by the [Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI)](https://stsci.edu). It enables fast access to data in the [MAST Archive](https://archive.stsci.edu) via a [cloud copy](https://registry.opendata.aws/collab/stsci/): at the moment, TESS, Hubble, Kepler/K2, and GALEX Observations are available. The principle advantage of TIKE is that no downloads are necessary; you can examine terabytes of data without needing to expand your hard drive. Additionally, we pre-install common astronomy packages, which makes TIKE an ideal teaching tool.

## What is Project TIKEBook?
Project TIKEBook is an open-source set of Jupyter Notebook lessons, designed to teach people to analyze astronomical data on the cloud. This set of lessons can be used in its entirety (e.g. as a once per week "lab"), but is also modular enough for a one-off class on data science.

## Getting Started
These lessons are pre-loaded into [TIKE](https://timeseries.science.stsci.edu) and are designed to work in our cloud environment. If you're not already reading this on the TIKE platform, you should switch to that now.

## Development and Use 

### Open-Source Classroom Use
Project TIKEBook is open-source under a BSD 3 license, and we encourage teachers (at any level) to use TIKE for lessons.

### I'd like to contribute!
Please do! We especially value feedback from people using the "TIKEBook" in a classroom setting, but everyone is welcome to open an issue or submit a pull request to the [Project TIKEBook Respository](https://github.com/spacetelescope/project-tikebook). 

New to Github? Welcome! Github hosts its very own [intro to github course](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github).

## Contact Info
If you have questions or comments that cannot be addressed through github, please send an email to the [MAST help desk](mailto:archive@stsci.edu?subject=Project-TIKEBook). Including "TIKEBook" and a relevant summary in the subject will help you to get a faster reply.
